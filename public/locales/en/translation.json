  "Here's how to get your paper ready for recycling: Remove any plastic or metal components: Paperclips, staples, binder clips, or any other non-paper elements should be removed before placing the paper in the recycling bin. These can contaminate the recycling stream. Empty envelopes: Remove any plastic windows or lining from envelopes before recycling them. Flatten cardboard boxes (optional): Flattening cardboard boxes saves space in your recycling bin, but it's not always mandatory.":"Here's how to get your paper ready for recycling: Remove any plastic or metal components: Paperclips, staples, binder clips, or any other non-paper elements should be removed before placing the paper in the recycling bin.

  "Here are some things to keep in mind: Check for contamination: Avoid placing food-soiled paper towels, napkins, or greasy pizza boxes in the recycling bin. Heavy contamination can disqualify the entire batch from recycling. Wet or moldy paper: Paper that is excessively wet or moldy should not be recycled. This can deteriorate the entire batch and disrupt the recycling process. Local guidelines: As mentioned earlier, consult your local waste collection provider's website for specific instructions on accepted paper types and any preparation requirements.":"Here are some things to keep in mind: Check for contamination: Avoid placing food-soiled paper towels, napkins, or greasy pizza boxes in the recycling bin.

  "While most clean paper products are recyclable, some exceptions exist: Paper cups: These often have a plastic lining that makes them unsuitable for curbside recycling. Check for specific instructions in your area. Wax paper and parchment paper: Due to the waxy coating, these are typically not accepted in curbside recycling. Carbon paper: The carbon residue can contaminate other recyclables, so it's usually not accepted in curbside programs.":"While most clean paper products are recyclable, some exceptions exist: Paper cups: These often have a plastic lining that makes them unsuitable for curbside recycling.

  "Here are some general tips for recycling plastic: Check the recycling code: Most plastic containers have a recycling symbol with a number inside (usually located on the bottom). This code indicates the type of plastic and helps sorting facilities determine if it's accepted in your program. Leave lids on: Contrary to popular belief, some recycling programs now accept lids with plastic bottles. Check your local guidelines. Don't bag your recyclables: Plastic bags can tangle equipment at recycling facilities. Place loose plastic items directly in the recycling bin. Rinse, but don't overdo it: A quick rinse to remove food or beverage residue is sufficient. When in doubt, throw it out: If you're unsure whether a plastic item is recyclable in your area, err on the side of caution and toss it in the trash.":"Here are some general tips for recycling plastic: Check the recycling code: Most plastic containers have a recycling symbol with a number inside (usually located on the bottom).
