Our models undergo rigorous training processes, starting with a vast dataset comprising over 14 million images. This initial training phase ensures that our models are equipped with a broad understanding of various waste materials. Following this, our models undergo a fine-tuning process on a smaller, waste-specific dataset, honing their ability to accurately classify waste items with precision and reliability. This method yields excellent results, allowing our models to distinguish between different types of waste effectively. With our advanced technology, you can trust our models to optimize waste management processes and contribute to a more sustainable future.")}
